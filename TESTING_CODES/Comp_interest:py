 # Amount = P(1 +r/n) * nt

 # P = principal amount (initial investment)
 # r = annual nominal interest rate (as a decimal)
 # n = number of times the interest is compounded per year
 # t = number of years

  # Let's calculate A  Using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)nt
  
P = 10000
n = 12
r = 0.08

Parenthesis = (1 + r/n)
Exponential= n*(int(input('number of years:')))
Amount = P *(Parenthesis**Exponential)
print(Amount)
